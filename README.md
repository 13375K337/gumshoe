Synopsis
--------

Gumshoe is a Chromium extension for discreet password logging. It monitors
the submission of all forms with a password field and stores any unique
login details in a local database.


Installation
-----------

The _Chrome Web Store_ isn't likely to host our **totally innocent**
extension, so it's _Plan B_:

1. Download _gumshoe.crx_ using Chromium (or Chrome)
2. Click "Continue" on bottom-left prompt
3. Click "Install" on popup prompt


Getting Started
---------------

Once installed, typing "gselog" anywhere should reveal the log management
page. From here, you can search for records, delete those records, and
change "gselog" to something more creative.

Provided that the extension is enabled and the user/password pair has not
previously been recorded, login attempts to most (semantically correct)
websites should be available for review through the log management page
(see above).


FAQ
---

**Aren't keyloggers scary and malicious?**

You could call it a keylogger, but 3 out of 4 pedants agree that it logs
form submissions, not keystrokes. (It monitors strokes as it listens for
the passcode, but they aren't recorded.)

**Right, but couldn't _you_ steal _my_ passwords?**

No. All data is stored locally using Web SQL; Gumshoe never communicates
with another machine (anxiety or something).

**Why isn't this in the _Chrome Web Store_, then?**

It still logs passwords.


Disclaimer

Gumshoe doesn't hurt users; users hurt users.
